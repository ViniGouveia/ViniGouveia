### üëã Hi there 

I'm Vinicius Gouveia, a passionate Mobile developer. I currently work as Android Mobile Developer at GFT Group.
With more than 3 years of experience in the area, I've had opportunity to work with a lot of different projects and their unique technologies.

### üöÄ Expertise

My primary focus is on Android development, where I specialize in develop well-writed and user-friendly applications for Android devices. I'm constantly studying about and learning the newest releases in the Android world. I have solid and extensive knowledge of Kotlin, Java and I'm familiar with the Jetpack libraries in addition to several architectural patterns such as MVP, MVVM and MVI.
My secondary focus is learning about Flutter. I recently start my journey in this field, so I can expand my horizons and my baggage in Mobile development.
