### üëã Hi there 

I'm Vinicius Gouveia, I am an Android Developer with 5 years of experience, passionate about building high-quality mobile applications. Throughout my career, I have contributed to a lot of projects in the financial, real estate, dairy, and cosmetics sectors, developing and optimizing scalable solutions that enhance user experience and business efficiency. My journey in mobile development has given me the opportunity to work with diverse teams, solve complex challenges, and continuously evolve my technical and analytical skills. I am driven by best development practices and a strong commitment to delivering impactful solutions that go beyond functionality.

### üöÄ Expertise

My expertise lies in Android development with Kotlin and Java, applying modularization and architectural patterns such as MVVM, MVI, and MVP to ensure maintainability and scalability. I have deep knowledge of Android security, including code obfuscation, encryption, and Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP), as well as experience in optimizing legacy applications while maintaining high unit test coverage (95%+). I actively work with Jetpack Compose, Room, Navigation, Retrofit, and Firebase, leveraging these technologies to enhance application performance and reliability. Additionally, I am a strong advocate for Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, and design patterns, always striving to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. My next goal for the future is to become a more well-rounded mobile developer. That‚Äôs why, in addition to my Android-focused studies, I will improve my skills in cross-platform applications.
